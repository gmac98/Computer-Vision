Convolutional Neural Networks


In this, we will be putting together a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) classification pipeline.
Fully-connected networks are a good testbed for experimentation because they are very computationally efficient, but in practice, all state-of-the-art results use convolutional networks instead.
Here, I have implemented several layer types that are used in convolutional networks and then used these layers to train a convolutional network on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
