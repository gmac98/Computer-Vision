# CS 5330 Programming Assignment 2: SIFT Feature Matching

The goal of this assignment is to create a local feature matching algorithm using techniques described in Szeliski chapter 7.1. The pipeline we suggest is a simplified version of the famous SIFT pipeline. The matching pipeline is intended to work for instance-level matching â€“ multiple views of the same physical scene.
