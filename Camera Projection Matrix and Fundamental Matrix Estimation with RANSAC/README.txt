Part 1: Projection matrix
  - Visualization of projected 3D points and actual 2D points for the CCB image we provided
  - Visualization of camera center for the CCB image
  - Visualization of projected 3D points and actual 2D points for the Argoverse image
  - Visualization of camera center for the Argoverse image
  - 3 factors that affect the camera projection matrix
      1. Camera (perspective projection)
      2. Image (intrinsic camera parameters)
      3. World (extrinsic camera parameters)

Part 2: Fundamental matrix
