# CS 5330 programming assignment 4: Softmax, SVM, and Fully-Connected Neural Network


In this assignment, we practice creating a simple image classification pipeline, based on the SVM/Softmax classifier and simple fully-connected networks. The goals of this assignment are as follows:
- Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
- Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning
- Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
- Implement and apply a two-layer neural network classifier
- Implement and apply an arbitrary-layer neural network classifier
- Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
